Brief professional introduction
I am a second year Master's student at Boise State University in the geophysics department. 
I work with Dr. Qifei Niu to research whether self-potential can be used to quantify evapotranspiration-driven 
water flux within a soil column. I received my undergraduate degree in geology from Western Kentucky University, 
and I am a Geologist-in-Training for the state of Kentucky. 

3-5 goals for this module
1.	I would like to understand GitHub better. I’ve never used it before and am just not super familiar with 
	much of the terminology (I’d never heard of a repository before). 
2.	I would like to understand folder navigation better. I had some issue at the beginning of the module trying 
	to find the original planet folder I made and had to restart the exercise from the top. 
3.	I would like to get more familiar with the basic commands and be able to create text, add it, commit it, etc. 
	on my own without the help of the directions.
